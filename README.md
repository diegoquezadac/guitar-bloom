# Guitar Bloom 🌱

A pretty simple page where I offer my guitar courses 🎸. This is my first personal project ⭐, and I've developing in order to remember some basic stuffs about Web Development and Web Design 💻.

### What is it about ❓

- ✨ The page offer three courses, which names are: Campfire, Rock - Metal and Lonely.
- 🎓 The page offer three learning plans, each with different prices.
- ✉️ The page provide a fairly basic form (it works through an email, there are no databases yet 😢) to register for a course. Sadly, as Git-Hub pages don't support .php files, the form it is not working, but it is implemented 😅.
- 👌 The page it is **responsive**.

### So ..., I'm a guitar teacher 🤔

I mean ..., I've done guitar lessons in my apartment and I've been playing the guitar since 2017 but sadly I haven't the time and the equipment in order to teach online. I wish I could, but you know , as a Computer Engineering student there are a lot of exciting things to learn. 💻

So ..., why did design this whole webpage? well ..., like I said Guitar Bloom was my first personal project and I thought maybe this page could one day be of help to me 😅.

### About the design 🎨

The design is hardly inspired on the second project of the "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3" course at Udemy ❤️.
